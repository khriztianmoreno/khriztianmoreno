Hi 👋🏻, I'm Cristian Moreno. On a daily basis I use: **JavaScript (ES6), React, Gatsby, CSS (inJS), GraphQL, Serverless**, just to name the most important bits. 
I'm a community leader and altruistic speaker. Currently co-organize [Medellin.js](http://medellinjs.org/) (Biggest JavaScript user group in Colombia), [Avanet](https://avanet.org/) and [JAMstack Medellin](https://www.meetup.com/jamstack-medellin/) communities.

I love developing things, especially ideas, giving them a new perspective and making them shine! products and applications come after I transform ideas into code; I'm passionate about software development and related stuff.

I bootstrap single page and statically generated React apps from scratch, on top of the Create React App and Gatsby frameworks using intuitive state management like Redux and core React features. I utilize CI tools like Circle CI and Netlify to build/deploy static sites.
